// falsifier-pen-flip.mjs — the flipped pen's standing check: the REVERSE
// direction, and the refusal that proves the ordering.
//
// LAW (DESIGN-pen-flip.md §3, ruled by Keemin 2026-08-29): for a flipped lane
// Postgres commits first and is awaited; sqlite receives the row AFTER, as the
// reverse mirror (D3) — "a rollback convenience, not a record". Two checks
// follow from that law, and each can fail:
//
//   1. REVERSE PARITY — every acts row on a flipped lane written since the
//      flip has its journal twin. The forward parity falsifier
//      (falsifier-acts-parity.mjs) iterates the JOURNAL, so it is structurally
//      blind to an acts row whose reverse write failed — the same blindness,
//      mirrored, that let the say gap stay green. This check iterates ACTS.
//      A missing twin is RED (the reverse mirror is behind — the loud
//      console.error should already have said so), never silently excused.
//
//   2. THE REFUSAL ORDERING (--prove-refusal) — with the pen pointed at an
//      unreachable Postgres, a flipped write must (a) throw the ruled
//      refusal, and (b) leave the sqlite journal EMPTY of the act. A refusal
//      that wrote sqlite anyway would be "1.0's pen holding a row the
//      resident was told did not happen" — the exact state R2 exists to
//      prevent. This is proven on a THROWAWAY in-memory sqlite db and a
//      deliberately wrong WORLD2_PG_URL; no real store is touched.
//
// Pairing key: flipped acts carry journal_seq NULL (001's own words: the
// shadow-era pairing key, dying at cutover), so the reverse pair is found the
// lane-closure way — (actor, action, written_at) with object as the
// tiebreaker — quoted from that falsifier's matcher rather than reinvented.
//
// ── TWO DEFECTS THE 2026-09-03 HOLD/SAY FLIP FOUND, AND WHAT THEY CHANGED ────
//
// FINDING 1 · THE JOURNAL IS NOT THE WHOLE OF THE ROLLBACK SET. Verbatim from
// w2-hold-say-flip-report.md § Findings: "`falsifier-pen-flip`'s reverse-parity
// arm goes blind after every crossing-save. It pairs flipped acts against the
// sqlite `journal` — and the drain TRUNCATES the journal at the save. On the box
// today: journal rows = 0; the three flipped stance acts reported 'NO journal
// twin — rollback would lose this act', while all three stand in 1.0's
// photograph — world main `STATE/log/165.7653.journal.jsonl` seq 899/900 and
// `167.journal.jsonl` seq 915. Rollback would NOT lose them."
//
// The check's question was always "would a rollback lose this act?", and the
// answer to THAT question is not held by one store. The drain moves a row from
// the journal into `STATE/log/<crossing>.jsonl` and pushes it to the world repo;
// `world-drain.logLine` is the conversion, and it photographs EVERY row (its
// marks half skips non-mark classes, its logs half does not). So the rollback
// set is the journal UNION the drained photograph, and the honest check reads
// both and SAYS WHICH SIDE each twin was found on. Found nowhere is the only RED.
//
// Two answers that are not RED and are not green either, each named rather than
// swallowed:
//   · NO CLONE SUPPLIED and an act is unpaired — the check cannot tell "drained"
//     from "lost" and exits 2 (cannot run). It must never call that green: an
//     act that really was lost would read exactly the same.
//   · NEWER THAN THE PHOTOGRAPH — the clone's newest log line is its horizon. An
//     act after it may simply not have been drained (or drained and not yet
//     pushed) and is UNDECIDABLE, named with the horizon and "fetch and re-run".
//     Below the horizon and in neither store is a real loss, and is RED.
//
// FINDING 2 · ONE CLOCK FOR LANES THAT FLIP ON DIFFERENT DAYS. Verbatim:
// "Asked for `--lanes stance,hold,say --since <the stance flip>`, it read 81
// mirror-era say acts (`journal_seq` NULL by the mirror's design, never flipped)
// as 'flipped acts lacking twins'." The pairing key cannot separate a flipped
// row from a pre-flip mirror row of the same lane; only the lane's own flip
// moment can. Those moments are now DATA — `LANE_FLIPPED_AT` in
// src/world2-acts.mjs, beside LANE_MIRROR, which is already the home for
// per-lane truth about the shim — and `--since` defaults from that table, per
// lane. A single bare `--since` still works and still means one clock for every
// named lane, because an operator asking "what happened after 18:58" deserves
// that answer; the tool says out loud that it is using one clock, so nobody
// reads the shape that produced the 81 false reds without being told.
//
// Run ON THE BOX:
//   WORLD2_PG_URL=... WORLD_CLONE=/path/to/postmark-world \
//     node world2/tools/falsifier-pen-flip.mjs --db <dynamic.db> [--lanes stance,hold,say]
// Exit 0 green · 1 red · 2 cannot run (a comparison that compared nothing, or
// one whose answer this store cannot supply).

/**
 * Resolve `--since` into ONE INSTANT PER LANE.
 *
 * Three shapes, and each says what it is in the returned `shape` so the output
 * can name it — an operator who cannot see which clock ran cannot judge the
 * answer:
 *
 *   null              every lane from its own row in LANE_FLIPPED_AT ("table")
 *   "<ISO>"           one clock for every named lane ("one-clock") — honest when
 *                     asked for deliberately, and the exact shape that produced
 *                     the 81 false reds when it was the only shape there was
 *   "stance=…,say=…"  per lane, and a lane the string does not name falls back
 *                     to its table row ("per-lane")
 *
 * A lane with no flip moment — null in the table, or absent from it — is
 * returned in `unflipped`. It is NOT given a since and NOT compared: its
 * `journal_seq`-NULL rows belong to the mirror, and pairing them against a
 * journal that never held them is finding 2 itself.
 *
 * AND NO SINCE EVER REACHES BACK BEFORE A LANE'S OWN FLIP. An operator's date
 * can narrow the window (ask about the last hour) and can supply one for a lane
 * the table calls unflipped (that is how the NEXT flip is checked at the moment
 * it happens); it cannot widen the window past the flip, because there is
 * nothing back there to widen INTO — every `journal_seq`-NULL row before a
 * lane's flip is the mirror's by construction, and asking about them is finding
 * 2 whatever shape the argument arrived in. Making the default per-lane and
 * leaving the explicit shape unclamped would have fixed the defect only for the
 * operator who did not type anything; the run that found the 81 typed a date.
 * A clamp is reported in `clamped` so the output can say it moved.

// `twinKey` assumes one declaration has one instant. A stake-released mark has

//
// Phase 5.6 defers an unstaked mark: `world-journal.mjs § privateDraftAct` writes
// the sqlite row at the COMPOSE and mirrors no act, "because an unstaked
// declaration is the resident composing, not the town acting". The act rides on
// the claim as `data._deferred_act` until a stake puts it forward, and
// `world2-claims.mjs § promoteDraftOnStake` then inserts it under its own
// heading: "THE ACT IS DATED AT THE PUTTING-FORWARD, not at the composing. The
// world witnessed a resident put this mark forward; it did not witness them
// thinking about it."
//
// So the two stores hold the same declaration under two instants ON PURPOSE, and
// the tuple cannot pair them. Measured on prod, 2026-09-05:

// photograph's horizon" — UNDECIDABLE, which is a blind spot wearing a soft
// word; and the moment a clone is fetched past 19:13:28 the same row becomes
// RED, "a rollback would lose this act", which is FALSE. Both failure modes, one
// row.
//
// WHY THE PAIRING MOVED AND NOT THE DATA. Carrying the compose instant on the

// published it. That is looser than the tuple and it is not free, so it is
// applied ONLY to mark-class acts (the only lane Phase 5.6 defers), only after
// the exact key has missed, and every row paired this way is COUNTED AND NAMED
// in the output. A check that quietly loosens is the thing this file exists to
// stop being.
//
// NO TIME WINDOW, deliberately. A bounded one would be the obvious guard and it
// would be wrong: `promoteDraftOnStake`'s own words are "you composed something,
// slept on it, and now you back it", and the deferred act is carried IN THE
