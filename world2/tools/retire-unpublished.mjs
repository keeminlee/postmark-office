//
// ── THE GAP, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The store never retired what the world unpublished. `marks.status` has
// allowed `'retired'` since 001_tables.sql:110 and `retired_window` has existed
// beside it since :112, and until this tool the only writers of either were
// `replay-ingest.mjs`'s backfill and `falsifier-standing-equality.mjs`'s own
// can-fail fixture — neither of them a live path. On the pre-cutover dump that
// read 1,019 standing and 0 retired, ever.
//
// The consequence is not a stale row. `materialize.mjs`'s `recomputeStanding`
// walks `WHERE status = 'standing'` and standing is a fact about the ground a
// mark stands on, so a mark that should have been retired keeps holding ground
// under its neighbours. That is why this runs BEFORE a recompute and never
// after, and why the step is a transaction rather than a nightly tidy.
//
// ── WHAT THIS TOOL CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ────────────────
//
// It closes ONE of the three doors a mark leaves canon by. The three were
// measured on world main before this was written, and saying which is which is
// most of the value here:
//
//   DOOR A · THE SWEEP'S UNPUBLISH — this tool's whole scope. A commons mark
//     the sweep previously admitted whose escrow has fallen to zero
//     (settlement-sweep.mjs:1161-1183). It leaves canon with a named channel
//     in a machine-readable report, at a known instant, on a crossing — which
//     is exactly what makes it mechanizable. `pistache-cone-for-julian` left
//     by this door at world `49e0fe89`.
//
//   DOOR B · A LAW OR HAND COMMIT ON MAIN — NOT closed here, and not closeable
//     at this seam. `the-town/pledges` was added at `7b1b03b1` and removed at
//     `6b235216`, a founder-ruled law commit ("the three asks", 2026-08-30).
//     No sweep ran, no channel named it, and there is no report for this tool
//     to read. Closing this door means the store learning to diff canon
//     against its own register, which is a different lane with a different
//     oracle — see the report's § what is still owed.
//
//   DOOR C · NEVER PUBLISHED AT ALL — not a retirement, and treating it as one
//     would be a lie in a new direction. `darko/the-second-foundation-stone`
//     and `wright/final-unstaked` have no file on any ref of the world repo,
//     ever; `little-bird/the-second-spoon-verdict` exists only on a draft
//     branch (drained at `5fe5e8b3`) and never reached main. A mark that never
//     stood cannot stop standing, and writing `retired` over it would record
//     "this stood and then ended" for something that did neither. These are a
//     MATERIALIZATION defect — the store locked a claim canon never carried —
//     and they belong to the draft/published lane, not to this one.
//
// A step that quietly retired all three classes would go green on the
// falsifier and be wrong about two thirds of the town. So this tool takes only
// what the sweep names, and the receipt says which door it acted on.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM THE SWEEP ─────────────────────────────
//
// The sweep runs inside the world checkout and holds no database credential;
// this holds `clearing_job` and no checkout. Merging them would give the sweep
// a store pen for the length of a crossing, which is the "the role happened to
// be handy" shape `snapshot-export.mjs` names as how a fourth writer gets born.
// The crossing chain joins them instead, and the join is one `&&`.
//
// ── LOUD, BECAUSE THE MIRROR TAUGHT US ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The reverse mirror was best-effort and fell behind five acts without a sound
// (flip-watch 09-06). This is not best-effort: a refusal exits 1, names the
// slug it died on, and writes nothing — the transaction rolls back whole. The
// crossing chain treats that as a refusal rather than publishing a receipt that
// claims a retirement that did not happen.

/**
 * The slugs a sweep report says left canon.
 *
 * ONLY `unpublished`. The sweep has six other outcome channels and none of them
 * is a retirement: `left_drafted` never published, `withdrawn` is the docket's
 * own lane (world2-claims.mjs:193), `quarantined` and `suite_quarantined` are
 * held back rather than let go, `dropped` is the-already-standing (a copy that
 * was never a conflict — the ORIGINAL still stands and retiring by that id
 * would retire the survivor), and `rebased` is git mechanics. Reading a second
 * channel into this step is how it would start retiring marks the world still
 * carries, which the negative control in the test asserts it does not.
 *
 * The sweep's rows carry `id` as the `<owner>/<name>` identity (its `published`
 * and `unpublished` entries are built from the same registry shape), which is
 * `marks.slug` — 001_tables.sql:102 calls that column "the 1.0 path identity".
