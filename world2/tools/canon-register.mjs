// canon-register.mjs — DOES CANON CARRY THIS SLUG, and at which state.
//
// ONE PREDICATE, TWO BACKENDS, READ AT ONE LINE. The nightly read
// (`falsifier-canon-locks.mjs`) and the review door's naming line
// (`review-rule.mjs`) ask the identical question of the identical function, so
// a listing of what slipped and a mind's ruling can never disagree about what
// "canon carries it" means. The candle does NOT ask it — the lock-time refusal
// was withdrawn the same day it was ruled; the two sections below carry why.
//
// ── THE RULING THIS SERVES (Keemin, 2026-09-08, postmark#2594), verbatim ─────
//
//   "RULED 2026-09-08 (Keemin, at the G1 sitting): refusal at the candle. A
//    claim that would lock while the mark it materializes has no file on main at
//    the locking crossing is REFUSED at the clearing job's lock step, naming the
//    slug and the world sha — not held for review. Reason as given: the three
//    instances were silent for weeks; a `held_review` row would have been just as
//    silent."
//
// `held_review` was never this check's outcome, and with the lock-time refusal
// withdrawn there is no candle call for it to be the outcome of: the read LISTS
// and the review door NAMES; neither holds anything for review.
//
// ── THE STATE THIS IS ASKED AT, AND WHY IT IS NOT `law_sha` ──────────────────
//
// The brief this was built from said to ask the question at "the crossing's world
// sha — the register the candle already reads", meaning
// `projection_heads['world-law']`, which `clearing-job.mjs` pins on every window.
// MEASURED ON PROD 2026-09-08 20:5xZ, that pin cannot answer the question:
//
//   · `projection_heads['world-law']` = a23a8d17, ingested 2026-09-05 19:44:51Z.
//     It has not moved in three days and WILL NOT: `postmark-world2-ingest.timer`
//     is parked BY FOUNDER RULING (2026-08-31 — "the shadow writer is the store's
//     sole pen; a re-lift from git would launder v1's record into v2's and
//     destroy the writer comparison the shadow era exists to make"). The box
//     roll-call reports that row as PARKED, not as an alarm.
//   · Of the 1,031 marks standing in the store, 27 have no file at that pin.
//     TWENTY-SIX OF THE 27 ARE ON WORLD MAIN TODAY. A refusal computed against
//     the pin would have refused twenty-six legitimate marks to catch one.
//   · And the ordering is the OPPOSITE of what this header first claimed. The
//     first draft said the settlement pushes at :45:2x and the candle closes at
//     :45:44, "twelve seconds later" — built from COMMIT timestamps, which are
//     local authoring times, while the candle fetches ORIGIN. The reviewer timed
//     the two units' journals against each other over seven consecutive
//     crossings: the push lands 3m04s to 3m41s AFTER the clear, every time, and
//     once 1h56m after. Seven for seven, never before. So no checkout the candle
//     can hold at lock time carries the marks its own crossing is locking.
//     That is this lane's own "freshness stamps name their own source" rule,
//     turned on its own table.
//
// ── WHERE THIS IS ASKED, AND WHY NOT AT THE CANDLE (RULED 2026-09-08) ───────
//
// The lock-time refusal is WITHDRAWN. Because the push lands minutes after the
// clear, a canon check at the lock step would refuse the marks its own crossing
// just locked — the reviewer measured today's 17:45 crossing refusing all three.
// Keemin ruled: the check moves off lock time to the backend this module already
// reserves, and the instrument becomes the NIGHTLY read plus the roll-call — a
// locked claim whose slug the crossing's fold did not materialize is the
// finding, hours later, when the push has long landed.
//
// `falsifier-canon-locks.mjs` runs on the NOTARY rail (03:20 UTC, between
// crossings) for exactly that reason: at 03:20 the 17:45 push is nine hours old,
// so the git backend answers about a world that has finished moving. At the G1
// swap the backend becomes `fold` and the class becomes structurally impossible,
// because the fold writes what the candle locked; the read stays as the detector.
//
// The sha that answered is still recorded as its own field, never borrowed from
// `law_sha` — one stamp, one source.
//
// THIS IS NOT A RE-LIFT OF THE PARKED INGEST. Nothing here writes a git-derived
// row into the store: the world is READ as a refusal oracle and the only thing
// written is a `refusal_check` string. The tension with the 08-31 park is real
// and is named in the lane's report for the conductor rather than settled here.
//
// ── THE READER IS THE CHECKOUT'S OWN ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `loadMarks` is imported out of the checkout being read, exactly as
// `law-ingest.mjs` and `seed-import.mjs` do it: the code that parses sha X is the
// code that shipped at sha X, and a copy would be a twin that drifts silently.
//
// The identity a record carries is `m.id` — `owner/name` — and that is the same
// string `marks.slug` holds. MEASURED, not assumed: 1,030 of the store's 1,031
// standing slugs join to a `loadMarks` id on world main at 91536f76, and the one
// that does not (`lupi/the-drift-room`) is a live standing mark canon has no file
// for. The PATH is a different string and is never the identity —
// `review-g1-retire.md` repair 1 is the receipt of that mistake.

/**
 * THE SAME QUESTION, ASKED AT A NAMED SHA INSTEAD OF AT THE CHECKOUT'S HEAD.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS A DEFECT A REVIEWER CAUGHT ───────────────────
 *
 * `canonRegisterAt` stamps `git rev-parse HEAD` and reads the WORKING TREE. On
 * the notary rail at 03:20 those are one state and the answer is right. On the
 * SETTLEMENT rail they are not:
 *
 *   `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` reads `WORLD_FROM` from `origin/main` and checks
 *   the clone out at it (:303-304). It then COMMITS `WORLD/households.json` onto
 *   that same clone whenever the household registry moved (:386-395) — before
 *   the fold runs. The script says so itself at :418-425: "main may already be
 *   ahead of origin/main at this line, because the registry refresh commits
 *   before the fold."
 *
 * So on any crossing after a household is declared, HEAD is ONE COMMIT PAST the
 * fold's `worldSha`. A register stamped HEAD would make `foldDelta`'s equality
 * check throw, `fold-input-cli.mjs` would turn that into `store-refused`, and the
 * crossing would publish nothing — intermittently, only on the crossings that
 * follow a household declaration.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS NOT TO LOOSEN THE CHECK. The register answers about the sha the
 * crossing names, so `register.sha === worldSha` holds BY CONSTRUCTION and the
 * equality check stays as the falsifier for the day something other than the
 * registry moves main before the fold.
 *
 * ── THE TREE IS MATERIALIZED, AND `loadMarks` IS STILL THE ONE PARSER ───────
 *
 * The obvious cheap version — `git ls-tree -r --name-only <sha>` and read the
 * slugs off the PATHS — is a second reader AND a recorded defect. The identity is
 * `<by>/<leaf>` where `by` comes from the mark's own frontmatter, not from the
 * directory above it: "The PATH is a different string and is never the identity"
 * (`review-g1-retire.md` repair 1, and the header above). So the blobs at the sha
 * are written to a scratch directory and the CHECKOUT'S OWN loader reads them,
 * exactly as it reads a checkout — one parser, one grammar, no drift.
 *
 * MEASURED before it was written, against the live world clone at HEAD: 1,206
 * mark records materialized and parsed in 1.4 s, and the slug set is IDENTICAL to
 * `canonRegisterAt`'s working-tree read at the same commit — zero slugs on either
 * side of the difference. Twice a day, that cost is nothing.
 *
 * NO `tar`, NO WORKTREE, NO INDEX. `git archive` needs an extractor this office
 * does not otherwise depend on; `git worktree add` leaves state in `.git` that a
 * killed crossing would strand in the settlement clone. `ls-tree` plus
 * `cat-file --batch` needs nothing but the git already required on every line of
 * this path, and it writes only into a scratch directory it removes itself.
 *
 * The loader is taken from the checkout's CURRENT tools, not from the sha's, and
 * that is deliberate and narrow: the sha this is asked at is minutes old on the
 * settlement rail, and importing a second copy of `marks-fold.mjs` per crossing
 * to parse a tree that has not changed grammar would be a cost with no reader.
 *
 * @param worldRepo  the checkout that HOLDS the object. Not fetched, not cleaned,
 *                   not modified — the stateless contract the sibling keeps.
 * @param sha        the 40-hex commit the answer must be true at. A ref name is
 *                   REFUSED: a register that named a moving pointer could not say
 *                   which state it answered for, which is the whole point of it.
