// ── IT REFUSES A NON-SCRATCH DATABASE ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read-only or not, a rehearsal instrument pointed at `world2_dev` is pointed at
// PROD — `/srv/world2-lab/lab.env` and `/etc/postmark-office.env` name the same
// database, and "there is a lab store" is a premise this month has now cost
// twice. So the connection string must name a database beginning `w2_scratch_`.
// The guard is on the NAME rather than on the statements because a SELECT-only
// tool is one careless edit from not being one, and a name is checkable before
// the first query rather than after the last.
