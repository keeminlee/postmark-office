// ab-compare.mjs — the Phase-4 A/B probe: the SAME reads against World 1.0 and
// World 2.0 on identical data, and every divergence named.
//
// Gold `postmark-world-2.md` §4 phase 4: "same reads against World 1.0 and 2.0
// on dev; thorough comparison; 'purely upside' is the bar." This is that
// comparison as a re-runnable probe rather than a one-afternoon transcript, so
// the bar can be re-checked after each fix instead of re-argued.
//
// It runs ON THE BOX, against the lab office that serves both worlds from the
// same frozen S47 data: 1.0 reads answer from the frozen world clone + its
// sqlite indexes, 2.0 reads answer from Postgres seeded from that same tag.
// Read-only throughout — HTTP GETs and SELECTs, nothing else.
//
//   node world2/tools/ab-compare.mjs
//
// Env: OFFICE (default http://localhost:4382), WORLD2_PG_URL, WORLD_CLONE.
// Exit 1 if any sweep reports an unreconciled divergence, so a suite can hold
// the bar mechanically.
//
// THE PROBE MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL. Two of this file's own comparators were wrong
// on the first pass and each invented a divergence that was not there:
//   · `g && g.at != null` yields `null`, not `false`, so a strict `!==` against
//     a real boolean fired on 422 marks where both sides agreed there was no
//     geometry. Presence tests coerce with `!!` for that reason.
//   · `acts.crossing` is the FRACTIONAL crossing, and Postgres `::int` ROUNDS.
//     Casting it that way moved half of every crossing's rows into its
//     neighbour and reported 27 of 33 crossings divergent when the truth is
//     zero. Bucketing floors, never casts.
// A green run here means the sweeps agree, not that the comparator is asleep;
// --self-test flips a known-good value in each sweep and asserts it goes red.
