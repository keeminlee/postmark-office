// replay-ingest.mjs — THE REPLAY-PARITY GATE. Phase 5 of the World 2.0 migration.
//
// THE LAW THIS IMPLEMENTS (gold plan postmark-world-2.md § 4, phase 5), verbatim:
//
//   "Phase 5 — the replay-parity gate (= Keemin's D-amendment, THE cutover gate):
//    World 2.0 must ingest the settlements/events that happened on prod in the
//    meantime and reach the same output state. The ingester is the migration's
//    proof and a harness we want anyway."
//
// ── WHAT "REACH THE SAME OUTPUT STATE" MEANS HERE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ──────
//
// This is INGEST-AND-REACH, not re-adjudicate. World 1.0 already ruled every one
// of these settlements; 2.0's job is to be handed the same era and arrive at the
// same register. So for each settlement S(k) the harness does four things:
//
//   (a) ACTS — the era's STATE/log rows become `acts`, by seed-import's own
//       `deriveActs`, MINUS the ones the store already holds. The era is the
//       multiset DIFFERENCE between the two tags, because 1.0 appends to a
//       crossing's log file AFTER the settlement that preceded it (S47→S48 adds
//       34 rows to `150.jsonl`, a file that already existed at S47 — see
//       `eraActs`). Since the first pen flip (stance, 2026-09-02) the log is
//       also a photograph of rows Postgres already wrote, so the derived set and
//       the store OVERLAP; `insertActs` dedupes by (actor, action, written_at)
//       and reports what it skipped. See its own note.
//
// ── AN ERA IS ONE PUBLISH, NOT ONE TAG (F-5, 2026-09-04) ────────────────────
//
// The Worldkeeper mints a `settlement/S<n>` tag when his JUDGMENT lands. The box
// publishes at every crossing and on demand between them, committing a
// `settlement: sweep N published, …` each time with its own six-count. Those were
// the same thing through S50 and have not been since: SEVEN publishes sit between
// the S50 and S51 tags. Pairing tags made one era out of seven, so six sweeps'
// worth of claims were derived against the seventh's receipt and every retirement
// filed at the last window instead of the one it happened at.
//
// So the boundaries are the publish commits; the tags are the RANGE's ends, the
// seed's floor, and the names an era wears when it has one. `erasBetween` walks
// `--first-parent` and takes every commit whose subject is a sweep.
//
// WHAT THIS DID NOT FIX, because the record says otherwise: a publish is not a
// window either. Five sweeps landed inside window 163 on 2026-09-01 (14:07,
// 14:28, 14:38, 14:47, then the 17:45Z crossing), and windows 154, 156–158 and
// 166 closed with no sweep behind them at all. A CROSSING closes a window; a
// sweep publishes into whichever one is open. `windowFindings` names every such
// departure and the run refuses, because the store clears exactly one candle at a
// time. See the report's F-5 section for the three readings and their costs.
//
//   (b) CLAIMS — the era's claim set is derived from the settlement's OWN
//       OUTCOME: the difference between the marks registers at S(k-1) and S(k),
//       read by `deriveSeed` at each tag. A mark that appeared is a claim that
//       was submitted in that window; a mark whose record changed is an amend,
//       carrying `supersedes` to the standing mark it continues. We do not
//       re-derive who MIGHT have claimed what — the settlement's outcome is the
//       record of what was claimed, and it is the only record that survives (the
//       sketchbook branches the claims actually lived on are rebased away, which
//       is gold §1's "rebased → ceases to exist: git mechanics, not a decision").
//       A mark that LEFT the register is a RETIREMENT, not a claim (DEC-15,
//       2026-09-04): `marks.status = 'retired'` at the era's window, with the
//       `withdraw` act either found in the era's log or synthesised by `the-town`
//       from the commit that removed the record. See `eraClaims`. A mark whose
//       FILE stayed while its `by:` changed did not leave at all — it CHANGED
//       HANDS (DEC-16, ruled 2026-09-04): the same row keeps its id, `slug` and
//       `owner` move together, `data.formerly` keeps the old name, one `transfer`
//       act by `the-town` names the commit, and the addition half is NOT a claim.
//       A departure of any OTHER shape still refuses the era, at the write rather
//       than at derivation, so one dry run shows the founder the whole class.
//
//       AND WHERE THE HAND IS THE FOUNDER'S OWN, THE CLAIM IS AN ADMISSION
//       (DEC-17, ruled 2026-09-04). A mark his commit on `main` put into the
//       register — no door, no sweep — is not a resident's claim for the clearing
//       job to adjudicate; it is canon already published, and a job that never
//       saw it must not be allowed to refuse it. So the claim goes in `locked`,
//       decided at the commit's own time, naming the commit in `data`, and the
//       mark materialises in the same transaction through the clearing job's own
//       `materializeClaims`. The same for an amend by that hand, superseding the
//       standing mark. The six-count receipt is UNCHANGED by this: 1.0 never
//       counted hand plantings either, which is why the disagreements it names
//       are the accounting and not a fault.
//
//   (c) LAW + STAMPS at the era's sha, by the ingester's own pen — `law_ingest`
//       against the S(k) checkout, so `law_projection` carries a row set stamped
//       with that settlement's sha and the clearing computes against law as-of
//       that moment (gold §3 rule 2's determinism property).
//
//   (d) THE REAL CLEARING JOB, on that window. Not a re-implementation and not a
//       shortcut: `clearing-job.mjs`, the pen that will run in production, under
//       its own role. That is the entire value of this gate. A parity failure
//       that came from a replay-only code path would prove nothing about the
//       cutover; a REFUSAL from the production pen on canon that 1.0 published is
//       precisely what we are here to find, and it is reported verbatim rather
//       than worked around.
//
// ── THE PARITY CHECK IS THE GATE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// After each window clears, 2.0's standing register must say what 1.0's says at
// S(k). The comparator is `seed-import.mjs`'s own `compareMarks` — the same code
// that verifies the seed, so a green replay and a green seed mean the same thing.
// Two scopes, and the split is deliberate rather than convenient:
//
//   SUBSTANCE (the gate) — kind, owner, household, body, geometry, bbox, status.
//     What the world IS. Any divergence here is a failed gate.
//   PROVENANCE (reported, not gated) — `locked_window` differs BY CONSTRUCTION
//     (a replayed mark locks in the window that actually cleared it, which is the
//     point), and any column 2.0's write path leaves NULL is reported as its own
//     named finding with a count, never silently narrowed away. A comparator that
//     quietly skips a column is the thing seed-import's own verifier is against.
//
// Plus ACTS COMPLETENESS per era: crossing by crossing, the checkout's log rows
// against `acts` — ab-compare.mjs's AB-P1 sweep, asked of one era instead of the
// whole history, and bucketed by FLOOR for AB-P1's own reason.
//
// ── THE STATELESS CONTRACT (gold § 2, the git-facing reuse line) ─────────────
//
//   "The two new sync jobs (law_ingester, snapshot_exporter) are built small and
//    STATELESS — GitHub-API commits or fresh shallow clone per run, discarded
//    after; NO long-lived clones on the box, which makes the month's entire
//    clone-pathology class (wedged rebases, ownership poisonings, stash/upstream
//    traps, ff-freezes) unrepresentable."
//
// The replay needs FOUR checkouts of one repo at once, which is the one place
// this contract needs a sentence of its own. The caller supplies a clone; this
// tool NEVER moves it — no checkout, no fetch, no rebase, no clean, and `HEAD`
// is exactly where the caller left it when the run ends. Each era's two trees are
// throwaway `git worktree --detach` checkouts in a temp directory, created from
// the caller's object store and removed on the way out. That is "a fresh checkout
// per run, discarded after", spelled for a tool that reads four shas.
//
// The clone must be FULL HISTORY. `--depth 1` carries one commit and the replay
// reads four; the world-hydrate lane already paid for that lesson.
//
// ── THE PEN: THIS IS A MIGRATION, NOT A RUNTIME PATH ────────────────────────
//
// Same pen and the same justification as `seed-import.mjs` and
// `ledger-backfill.mjs`: this connects as **world2_owner** to insert the era's
// `acts` and its pending `claims`, because those are the seed's own tables and
// this is the seed's own class of operation — a migration, run by hand, not
// reachable from any request path. It holds NO pen over an outcome: the clearing
// runs as `clearing_job` and the law ingest as `law_ingester`, each shelled to
// its own tool with its own credential, exactly as `clearing-job.mjs` shells to
// `stamp-ingest.mjs` rather than borrowing its grants.

// a rebuild. `--help` prints how to re-floor.

  // after `crossing-save N` and before `crossing-save N+1` happened in window N.
  // Verified against the record — `crossing-save 163` lands 12:03Z on 09-01 and
  // the five sweeps that follow it (14:07, 14:28, 14:38, 14:47, 17:45) all
  // resolve to 163 by the log rule, while `settlement: sweep 9 …` at 06:11Z,
  // before it, resolves to 162.
  //
  // The era's `to` is the LAST COMMIT of the segment, whatever kind it is. Not
  // the last publish: a `drain:` commit after it photographs more log rows into
  // the same window, and stopping at the publish would push those acts into the
  // NEXT era — filing them at a crossing they did not happen in, which is the
  // exact defect this lane exists to remove. The register is unchanged by a
  // drain, so the parity oracle reads the same world either way.
  // ── A WINDOW BEGINS WHERE ITS LOG FILE DOES (ruled 2026-09-04, § 9) ────────
  //
  // The first cut of this read the HIGHEST INTEGER `<n>.jsonl` at each boundary
  // commit. That is what `genesisWindow` does, and it is right whenever the town
  // saves on time — but it LAGS a missed save, and this range carries one. There
  // is no `crossing-save 154` anywhere in the repository: `154.jsonl` was not
  // written until `c701988f9` (crossing-save 155) at 13:27Z on 08-28, hours after
  // window 154 had come and gone. So the integer scan saw the clock go 153 → 155,
  // reported a hole, and filed two sweeps that published INSIDE 154 under 153.
  //
  // The `.journal` form does not lag. A drain, `a31796fac` at 06:05Z that
  // morning, wrote `154.journal.jsonl` while the integer log still said 153 — and
  // 06:05Z is inside window 154's own declared span (`154.meta.json`: covers_from
  // 08-28T00:00, covers_to 08-28T12:00, complete). The journal tracks the real
  // clock; the integer file is a save's record of it, and a save can be missed.
  //
  // So a window's boundary is the FIRST commit naming either form of its log,
  // whatever that commit's subject says. `crossing-save N` is the common case, a
  // drain the honest exception, and the exception is reported by name rather than
  // smoothed. One `git log` answers it for every window at once — cheaper than
  // the per-commit `ls-tree` it replaces, and it sees a window the tree cannot.

 * row are not authored at all: the seed asks the FOLD for them (seed-import §
 * foldOracle), and the fold answers about a record only after it has resolved the
 * WHOLE WORLD —
 *
 *   `household`   the fold's `declared_household` (`households[handle] ?? solo:…`)
 *   `data.tier`   the fold's `markStanding` walk, which reads `_sovereign`,
 *                 `_cred` and `_containedBy`
 *
 * — so either can move because somebody ELSE's mark landed. That is not a
 * hypothetical: between S48 and S49, `berthillon/le-petit-berthillon` goes
 * `tier: market → home` with every authored byte identical, because
 * `berthillon/chez-antoine` (a new PARCEL, someone else's claim in the same
 * window) gives the standing walk sovereign ground to stop at. Counting it as an
 * amend would have submitted a claim on that resident's behalf that they never
 * made, and it would have put the era's claim count at 15 against the
 * settlement's own receipt of 14 published — which is how it was caught.
 *
 * The parity check still compares both fields, and must: the STANDING STATE has
 * to agree with 1.0's whatever caused it to move. That split is what turned the
 * le-petit-berthillon case from a miscount into finding 4 — and finding 4 is now
 * closed at the other end: `clearing-job.mjs` step 7 recomputes standing for
 * every mark inside the window transaction, which is 1.0's own cadence

 * What changed in the register between two settlements, as a claim set.

 * a window received and the mark it materializes are the same record wearing two
 * table names (001: `marks.id` = "the locking claim's id"). Deriving the claim
 * any other way would put a second reading of a mark record into the system, and
 * the parity check would then be comparing two of our own readings rather than
 * the world to the world.
 *
 * Three transitions, and only three are representable:
 *   ADDED     a slug the previous settlement did not carry → a claim, pending.
 *   AMENDED   a slug both carry, whose record differs → a claim that supersedes
 *             the standing mark (its locking claim's id).
 *   RETIRED   a slug the previous settlement carried and this one does not.
 *
 * REMOVED USED TO STOP THE REPLAY, and the refusal was right until it fired:
 * "the refusal exists so that the first one is seen." It was seen on 2026-09-04,
 * on the first full-range dry run (S47 → S55): `the-town/pledges`, removed by the
 * founder's own commit 6b235216d, the three-asks ruling of 2026-08-30. DEC-15
 * (runbook § 9) is the ruling that answers it, and this is that ruling:
 *
 *   A standing mark that leaves the register between settlements is a
 *   RETIREMENT — the revision family's TERMINAL SUPERSESSION, founder-ruled
 *   2026-08-19: "the record leaves canon, its whole life stays in the log."
 *   It is not an invention: the store already spells it (001_tables:
 *   `marks.status IN ('standing','retired')`) and the door already performs it
 *   (`withdrawMarkViaOffice` — "the node leaves your sketchbook now and canon at
 *   the next crossing"). What was missing was the replay's reading of it.
 *
 * A retirement is NOT A CLAIM and does not enter the docket. A claim is something
 * a resident submitted into a window for the clearing to rule on; a retirement is
 * the register having already lost the row by the time the settlement landed. So
 * it rides beside `claims` rather than inside it, and the six-count receipt is
 * untouched — 1.0 never counted founder removals in `published`.
 *
 * TWO CASES, AND THE REPLAY MUST SAY WHICH:
 *   (a) WITHDRAWN IN THE LOG — the era's acts carry a `withdraw` naming the slug.
 *       That act IS the retirement; it is already replayed by `eraActs` and this
 *       synthesises nothing. A resident's own hand, and the log already has it.
 *
 *       AND 1.0 ALREADY COUNTED IT. The refusal this replaces said "1.0's
 *       six-count has no transition that describes a STANDING mark leaving" —
 *       that sentence was wrong, and `sixCountOf` three functions up has always
 *       parsed the counter that proves it: `(\d+) withdrawn`. S55's own receipt
 *       reads "sweep 7 published, 1 unpublished, 45 left drafted, 1 WITHDRAWN",
 *       and that one is `vermillion/the-track-garage`, whose `withdraw` act sits
 *       in the era's log at 2026-09-02T17:32:06.898Z. So case (a) is not a rule
 *       DEC-15 adds to 1.0; it is a transition 1.0 has been counting all along
 *       and 2.0 had no reading for. Only case (b) — the founder's hand on `main`,
 *       which passes no door and enters no sweep — is genuinely uncounted, and
 *       that is why the six-count check stays exactly as it was.
 *   (b) THE FOUNDER'S HAND — no act exists, because the removal was a commit on
 *       world `main` and never passed a door. The log would then be missing the
 *       one event that explains the register, which is exactly what 08-19 forbids
 *       ("its whole life stays in the log"), so the replay SYNTHESISES a
 *       `withdraw` by `the-town` carrying the removing commit's sha and subject.
 *
 * Case (b) needs the removing commit, which needs the mark's FILE, which is a
 * fact of the checkout and not of the register — hence `worldRepo`/`fromSha`/
 * `toSha`. A removal this pen cannot attribute to a commit is still a refusal: a
 * retirement with no hand behind it is the invention DEC-15 was careful not to be.
 *
 * ── AND A DEPARTURE MAY NOT BE A DEPARTURE AT ALL (DEC-16, RULED 2026-09-04) ──
 *
 * The first full-range dry run turned up a third shape wearing the same
 * description, and it is not a retirement: `the-town/the-lit-name`, whose FILE
 * stayed exactly where it was while its `by:` changed (world 17103dc37 — "the Lit
 * Name passes to wright … refolds the id"). A mark's id is `by` + leaf, so the
 * slug moved with the owner and the register read one removal plus one addition
 * for one record changing hands.
 *
 * DEC-16 rules that a TRANSFER IS A RE-IDENTIFICATION: the same row keeps its
 * `id`, `slug` and `owner` move together, `data.formerly` keeps the old slug, and
 * one `transfer` act by `the-town` names the commit. The alternative — retire the
 * old and claim a new one — was rejected for what it costs: the mark's escrow and
 * its whole history hang off the old identity, and a new row inherits none of it.
 *
 * The tell is the FILING, which is why this pen reads it: same path at both tags,
 * a different id standing there. Removal alone cannot distinguish the two, and
 * the register alone cannot either — only the file can say the record survived.

  //
  // A transfer reads as one removal AND one addition, and the addition is the
  // sharp end of the ruling. Left in `added` it would derive a claim whose id is
  // the mark's own — `uuid5(new slug)` — and the clearing job would materialize a
  // SECOND marks row under a slug the transferred row is about to take, colliding
  // on `UNIQUE(slug)`. Worse if it did not collide: two rows for one record, the
  // old one orphaned with every by-id reference still pointing at it. Nobody
  // claimed this mark; it changed hands.
  //
  // WHAT SURVIVES AS A CLAIM is anything the author ALSO did in the same era. The
  // comparison is `was` wearing the new owner against `now`: if they agree, the
  // only thing that moved is the identity and there is nothing to claim; if they
  // differ, someone edited the record as well, and that edit is an amend like any
  // other — under the NEW slug, superseding the standing mark's locking claim.

    // A RENAME-TRANSFER'S EDIT HALF IS NOT ADMITTED, and it does not need to be.
    // `amendedByHand` asks `--diff-filter=M` at the mark's CURRENT path, and a
    // rename registers there as an addition, so the founder's hand is invisible to
    // that probe even though the transfer act beside it names the very same
    // commit. `wright/the-candle-vault` is the live case: one amend claim, pending.
    // It reaches the right answer anyway — the clearing job's step 1 finds a
    // standing mark at the new slug whose id IS this claim's `supersedes` (the
    // transferred row kept it), so it locks as an amend rather than refusing as a
    // duplicate. Named because it is residual exposure of the exact kind DEC-17
    // removes: the candle judges it, and a candle that judges can refuse.

    // ── WHAT A TRANSFER'S PREDICATED CHILDREN NEED, WHICH DEC-16 DOES NOT CARRY
    //
    // DEC-16's seam table says `marks.parent` "names a mark by id … follows for
    // free. This is what the fixed id buys." That sentence is true of the STORE
    // and false of the ORACLE, and M-8 is the first era where the difference is
    // reachable, because it is the first transfer with a child.
    //
    // The store's child row points at the parent's kept id and stays right. But
    // `deriveSeed` RE-DERIVES a child's parent from the parent's SLUG at each
    // checkout, so at S(k+1) the child's parent reads `uuid5(new slug)` — a
    // number no row carries, because the transferred row kept `uuid5(old slug)`.
    // Measured on the record rather than reasoned:
    //
    //   the-town/the-unlit-cake   a6cfdfdb-ae34-5778-9c9a-3e733841eb53  (kept)
    //   wright/the-unlit-cake     c4549660-3491-5d91-b48c-699716e9ca13  (derived)
    //   the-town/the-lit-name's `parent` moves from the first to the second
    //
    // `marks.parent uuid REFERENCES marks(id)` (004) is a real, non-deferrable
    // foreign key, so materializing that child's amend does not go wrong quietly
    // — it is REFUSED, mid-era, by the clearing job. This pen says so up front
    // instead, before a connection is opened: a green dry run on a range the
    // store would refuse is the exact falsehood § 9 traded away.

/**
 * A DEPARTURE DEC-15 DID NOT RULE ON. It refuses at the WRITE, not at derivation.
 *
 * DEC-15 is a ruling about ONE transition — a standing mark that leaves the
 * register — and the first full-range dry run turned up two shapes wearing that
 * one description:
 *
 *   `the-town/pledges`      the file was DELETED (founder commit 6b235216d). The
 *                           record left canon. That is the retirement DEC-15 ruled.
 *   `the-town/the-lit-name` the file was MODIFIED — world 17103dc37, 2026-08-31,
 *                           "the Lit Name passes to wright … restake on
 *                           wright/the-lit-name owed after the next crossing
 *                           REFOLDS THE ID". `by:` changed, and since a mark's id
 *                           is `by + leaf` (marks-fold § walkMarks) the slug moved
 *                           with it. The record never left canon; it changed hands.
 *
 * Calling the second one a retirement would put a `withdraw` in the log for a mark
 * nobody withdrew and would retire a row whose record is still standing three
 * directories away — the invention DEC-15 spent a paragraph not being. And 2.0
 * has no word for it yet: `marks.slug` is the identity and `uuid5(slug)` the id,
 * so a re-identification is a new row and an orphaned old one, which is a RULING
 * about ownership transfer and not a thing a replay may decide on its own.
 *
 * SO THE REFUSAL MOVED RATHER THAN LEAVING. The old code threw inside `eraClaims`,
 * which meant the very first unruled departure hid every one after it — the S47 →
 * S55 dry run stopped at S51 and told the founder about one mark when there were
 * two shapes to rule on. Derivation now CLASSIFIES all of them and the write
 * refuses; `--dry-run` exits non-zero and names them. "The refusal exists so that
 * the first one is seen" — and a refusal that shows the founder the whole class
 * sees it better than one that shows him its first member.

// against the pen's rows). At F1 (cutover-eve replay-parity) a flipped-era row
// would be derived a second time."
//
// It is the STANCE lane's seam too, since 2026-09-02, and it widens with every
// lane that flips. `deriveActs` reads a photograph of the journal; a flipped
// lane's journal row is the REVERSE MIRROR of an act Postgres already holds. So
// after a flip, one act exists twice in the sources this tool reads, and without
// this dedupe the replay would write it twice — silently, because `acts` is
// append-only and has no uniqueness the store could refuse on.
//
// THE DROPPED ALTERNATIVE, and why: have the drain skip flipped lanes' rows.
// That keeps the ingest naive at the cost of tearing holes in 1.0's photograph —
// the public record of the town would stop carrying what residents said. The

 * keeps 2,400 imported rows from voting in a vocabulary they predate"), while
 * the pen writes the verb bare — `say`, `take`, `declare-stance-on`. The two
 * spellings ARE the same act; a key that did not know that would call every
 * flipped-era row fresh and insert it, which is the defect. Stripping on both
 * sides also makes the key idempotent against a store that already holds
 * previously-derived `legacy:` rows.
 *
 * `object` is deliberately NOT in the key. The drain photographs it and
 * `deriveActs` sets it NULL by design (the log states an emission's own id, not
 * a thing acted upon), so including it would make every pair miss. Actor +
 * action + instant is already tight: two acts by one actor of one verb in the

 * The victim is a mark this REPLAY put there (`locked_window > floor`), not a
