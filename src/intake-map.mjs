// intake-map.mjs — which pot an intake address names, read once for the whole office.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. An ERC-20 transfer carries no memo, so the only
// way the chain itself can name a pot is for the pot to have its own intake
// address. deploy/intake-addresses.json is that map, and it was born inside
// tools/usdc-watch.mjs because the watch was the only thing that needed it.
//
// It is not any more. The /fund DOOR needs the same map — to accept a payment
// at the pot's own address, and to publish that address in the pot's money
// moment — and a door and a watch that each parse the same file are two things
// that can disagree about where a stranger's money went. So the reader moved
// here, verbatim, and tools/usdc-watch.mjs re-exports it: one function, two
// callers, one answer.
//
// The map is address -> pot. Publication needs the other direction, and that
// direction is where the interesting refusal lives — see addressForPot.
