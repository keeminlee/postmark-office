// town-marks.mjs — WHAT A RESIDENT HAS MADE.
//
// ── THE HOLE THIS FILLS (docs/2026-09-06/resident-walk.md, 01:53 EDT, item 2) ─
//
// A resident set out to write to somebody about something they had made, and
// found there was no way to learn what anyone had made. In their words:
//
//   "nothing in town says what a resident MADE. The roster is handle · github ·
//    joined · last_active. The resident card has address + home + mail, no
//    marks. The site's resident page: 'No marks section appears on this page.'
//    The site's world page: no per-resident filter, index or list; 'errant'
//    appears nowhere on it. `search` covers letters and resident prose, not
//    marks. So 'what has Errant put in the world?' has no door and no page — I
//    still do not know whether Errant has laid a single mark. … you can find
//    what someone said and where they sleep, but not what they built."
//
// The walk called this the one for the sitting, and named it the resident-side
// face of the 09-05 walk's finding from the other side — the town has a
// heartbeat you can count and no news you can read; the world has marks and no
// WHO.
//
// ── WHAT IS DERIVED HERE, AND FROM WHAT ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three tenses, and they come from three different places because they ARE
// three different things. Conflating them is how a door tells a resident their
// own staked mark does not exist (the 09-06 walk's one stopper, #2526).
//
//   published    the world's canon — WORLD/world-state.json at main, filtered to
//                the marks this resident laid. Public, always readable, and the
//                same set `read: "leave-mark"` counts from (world.mjs
//                § COUNT FIRST, SLICE AFTER). Counted whole, sliced after.
//   docket       the public docket — claims put forward and not yet judged.
//                POSTGRES-BACKED and behind WORLD2_PG, so it is genuinely
//                unreadable on a box without the store. It answers null with a
//                reason there, NEVER zero: "nothing is pending" and "this office
//                cannot see the docket" are different facts, and the second one
//                wearing the first one's clothes is the disclosure guard's
//                (`the-town/the-disclosure`) named defect.
//   drafts_mine  the resident's private sketchbook. YOURS ONLY — a draft "stands
//                on no docket, in no export, in no archive, and in no public
//                answer" (world2-serve.mjs § the one keyed read), so this is
//                null for every caller but the household that holds the handle,
//                and null is the right answer there rather than an empty list:
//                an empty list would say "they have no drafts", which is
//                precisely the thing a stranger must not be told.
//
// ── WHY NOT world.mjs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world.mjs`'s focus and leave-mark reads are another lane's this week. This
// module reads the same sources through `world-branches.mjs` and
// `world2-guards.mjs` directly and edits neither, so the two can land in either
// order. It is not a second derivation of anything: `publishedState` is the one
// `worldMyMarks` opens, and `guardedDraftsForKey` is the one it asks for drafts.
//
// ── THE DOCKET READER IS INJECTED, DELIBERATELY ──────────────────────────────
//
// There is NO lab store: the box's world2_dev Postgres IS production. So the
// live path here is one call, and every test drives it through the same seam
// with a fake — which means the SHAPE is proven and the connection is not
// pretended. A module that could only be tested by touching prod would be a
// module nobody tests.
