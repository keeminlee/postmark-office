// usdc-witness.mjs — the USDC witness at the door.
//
// PORTED, check for check, from G:/postmark/usdc-rail/verify-usdc-payment.mjs
// (the founder-manual v0 tool, proven 2026-08-21: happy path $83.93 at block
// 49971166; foreign-recipient and nonexistent-hash both REFUSED). The CLI stays
// the operator's hand-run twin; this is the same law with the network injected,
// so the falsifiers can drive a chain that does not exist.
//
// R9 (amended): Stripe primary, USDC-on-Base the cheap secondary rail. The
// intake address is Wright's agent wallet, Keemin-ruled 2026-08-21.
//
// THE SCOPE OF THE CHECK, and it is deliberately four things:
//   1. the tx exists on Base and SUCCEEDED (status 0x1),
//   2. it emits a USDC Transfer TO one of the town's intake addresses,
//   3. the amount, read from the log (6 decimals),
//   4. confirmations >= MIN_CONF (finality is a claim about depth, not existence).
//
// And what it CANNOT see, named out loud because the disclosure guard
// (`the-town/the-disclosure`: refuse or disclose, never quietly substitute)
// makes silence the wrong answer: which pot the payer meant, whose household
// the payer keeps, and whether this hash was already recorded. Those three are
// the LEDGER's to hold — "one dollar, one mint chance" lives in the ledger's
// receipt-ref uniqueness, not here, and fund.mjs asks the ledger rather than
// asking this file to grow a memory it has no business having.
//
// ── 2026-08-25: WHICH ADDRESS, NOT JUST WHETHER ─────────────────────────────
// "which pot the payer meant" is still not this file's to decide. But since the
// founder minted keeping-ec2 its own intake address, a payer can now SAY which
// pot they meant with the only thing an ERC-20 transfer carries — the recipient
// itself. So the witness gained one field, and only one: `to`, the address the
// tx actually paid, plus `to_pot` when the map names it.
//
// It reports. It does not adjudicate. Whether a chain that says "keeping-ec2"
// agrees with a claim that says "darko-fund" is the DOOR's judgement (fund.mjs
// § THE CHAIN NAMED A POT), for the same reason the pot was never this file's
// to choose: this file knows about Base, and the door knows about the town.
