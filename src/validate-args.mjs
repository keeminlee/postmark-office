// validate-args.mjs — THE ONE "DOES THIS DOOR TAKE THAT FIELD" TEST.
//
// Lifted out of `mcp.mjs` on 2026-09-11, unchanged in its logic, for the same
// reason `reach.mjs` was lifted out of `world-crossings.mjs`: a second caller
// arrived, and the alternative to one owner is two copies that agree the day
// they are written and disagree the first time either moves.
//
// The second caller is the three apexes' READ branches. They cannot import
// `mcp.mjs` — it imports them, and a cycle is the reason their schemas are
// handed DOWN as data ("a line of data beats a cycle", household-apex.mjs
// § ctx). A module neither of them owns is importable by both. `mcp.mjs`
// re-exports this so `server.mjs` and every existing test keep the import they
// already have, and nothing outside had to learn a new name.
//
// ── WHY THE APEXES NEEDED IT (the parity finding, 2026-09-11) ────────────────
//
// `validateArgs` has existed since 2026-07-20, written after "six hours of one
// household's confusion for want of a field name". It was wired into the flat
// tools — which were then delisted — and into the world and household ACT
// branches, and into no read branch anywhere. So the door a connecting agent
// actually holds, `town { read: "letters", args: { from: "glitch" } }`, answered
// 200 and the WHOLE CORPUS labelled as matching, while the flat `list_letters`
// refused `from` by name. The office's own answer to this defect was live and
// unreachable. Ruled by the founder the same day: "yes on parity shape."

/**
 * Argument validation at the door (the little-bird finding, 2026-07-20).
 * Connector clients don't enforce inputSchema, so schema-violating calls used
 * to fall through to SQL and answer with a raw driver bind error ("Provided
 * value cannot be bound to SQLite parameter 1") dressed as "the office
 * tripped" — six hours of one household's confusion for want of a field name.
 * The door now names the defect itself: unknown params, missing required
 * fields, wrong types, bad enum values — each bounces with the field spelled out.
 *
 * `noun` is the word the HINT uses for the thing being called, and it exists
 * because the same validator now answers at two kinds of door. A flat tool says
 * "this tool takes: …"; an apex read says "this read takes: …", which is the
 * cold-read half of the founder's ruling — a caller who has just been refused a
 * field name is owed the list of names that would have worked. The default
 * keeps every sentence this function has ever spoken byte-identical.
 *
 * Returns null when the arguments are good, so `if (validateArgs(...))` reads
 * as "if something is wrong".

/**
 * THE APEX READ BRANCHES' ONE CALL, so the three of them cannot drift into
 * three answers to "does this read take that field".
 *
 * `properties` is the read's declared field set — the flat tool's own
 * `inputSchema.properties` where the apex forwards to a flat tool (every town
 * read does), and the apex's own declaration where it does not (the household's
 * twelve reads speak `view`, not `box`; the world's shadows take a subset of
 * their act's fields). Absent entirely means the caller did not wire the
 * schemas, which is a WIRING defect and never a caller's: it is answered as one
 * rather than skipped, because a validator that silently stops validating is
 * the quiet failure this whole lane exists to end.
 *
 * ⛔ REQUIRED IS DELIBERATELY NOT ENFORCED HERE, and this is the one narrowing.
 * Several apex reads resolve `handle` from the KEY after this point — a
 * single-resident household's `household { read: "doorstep" }` is the door's own
 * advertised first read and names no handle — while the flat `read_doorstep`
 * marks `handle` required. Enforcing it would refuse calls that answer today,
 * and the ruling was about unknown fields being SWALLOWED, not about tightening
 * what a valid call may omit. So the required list is emptied and the unknown /
 * type / enum legs run exactly as the flat door runs them.
 *
 * @returns null, or `{ defect, hint, extra }` for the caller's own `bounce`.
