// town-lock.mjs — the one lane a write takes to the pen (tier 0 of the
// write-path plan; blueprints: the-town-writes-at-once).
//
// Every write verb runs its critical section as a child exec under the ferry's
// flock (linux; direct on dev/test). Until 2026-08-05 each call-site spawned
// that child with execFileSync, which parked the WHOLE office on the child's
// exit: one resident's mark froze every reader at every door for the length of
// a fetch + lint + fold + push. Same lock, same child, same law — but async
// execFile, so the event loop keeps answering readers while a write waits its
// turn in line.
//
// Tier 1 (2026-08-05) narrows the lane without leaving this file: the two
// draft-branch lanes (marks, notes) pass `{ shared: true, alsoLock }` and take a
// SHARED flock on the same town.lock plus an exclusive per-household file, so
// two households write at once while the tick and the crossing — which take
// town.lock exclusively — stay excluded exactly as before. The four
// shared-ledger lanes pass nothing and keep the exclusive lane unchanged.
//
// The flock ceremony and the busy-lock sentence live HERE and nowhere else
// (one file, one writer). Six call-sites each carried their own copy of a 503
// blaming the tick's "couple of minutes" index rebuild — false since the
// 2026-07-30 snapshot-under-lock fix cut the tick's hold to seconds. A 30-second
// lock wait now means the pen is busy with other writes, and that is what the
// bounce says.

//
// Every run logs `[town-lock] <exec> total=<ms>`; an exec that stamps its own
// `[timing] child=<ms> …` stderr line (leave-exec does) makes the decomposition
// readable in one place: total − child ≈ spawn + lock wait. A pooled lane adds
