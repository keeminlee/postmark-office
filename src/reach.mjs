// reach.mjs — THE ONE "DO YOU TRULY STAND THERE" TEST.
//
// Law: `the-town/the-reach`, a child of the attach class, ruled by the founder
// 2026-09-07 (world PR #21, LOGOS/classes.md § The reach of a hold):
//
//   "A take is a threshold act. To take a thing you stand within its extent,
//    EXACTLY AS an entry stands at a threshold you truly stand before
//    (the-town/enter)."
//
// The operative words are "exactly as". A take is not a new containment
// question wearing a hold's clothes — it is the SAME question the enter door
// has been asking since the at-the-door ruling of 2026-08-27, asked about a
// thing instead of a door. So this file holds that test once and both doors
// call it.
//
// ── THE WORD THAT LEFT, 2026-09-11 ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file used to call the tolerance leg a DOORSTEP. In the town a doorstep
// is a resident's front step — where mail lands and the day's first read is
// taken (`read_doorstep`, `household { read: "doorstep" }`,
// `DOORSTEP_SEGMENTS`). Two meanings on one word, and the founder ruled the
// geometric one out: "doorstep means something else."
//
// The margin is now a REACH — this module's own name, the name of the law it
// quotes (`the-town/the-reach`), and the plain fact of what is measured: how
// far a thing is from you. THRESHOLD was the other candidate and was refused,
// because this office already spends that word on the door ITSELF
// (`THRESHOLD_KINDS`, the threshold ledger, "a take is a threshold act") — so
// naming the margin "threshold" would have rebuilt the very collision the
// rename exists to end, one word over.
//
// The resident's doorstep keeps its name everywhere. Only the geometry moved.
//
// THE ID WAS CHECKED, NOT ASSEMBLED. A day-old lesson: an id built in code out
// of a class name and a slot is a guess, and one shipped last night naming a
// node that does not exist. This one is the founder's own text ("Rendered in
// the world as `the-town/the-reach`"), and it agrees with the convention its
// two live siblings keep — `WORLD/marks/…/position/the-anchor/mark.md` is
// `the-town/the-anchor` and `…/thing/the-not-ground/mark.md` is
// `the-town/the-not-ground`, both verified against the train's own
// world-state.json, both `<by>/<leaf>`. `…/attach/the-reach/mark.md` with
// `by: the-town` is therefore `the-town/the-reach`.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS AN EXTRACTION AND NOT A NEW PREDICATE ────────────────────────
//
// The test lived inline in `enterViaOffice` (world-crossings.mjs) and nowhere
// else. Writing a second copy for the hold door is the split-brain this office
// keeps a museum of, and it would fail the exact way those always fail: the two
// would agree the day they were written and disagree the first time either
// moved. The enter arm now calls this, so a change to "truly stand" is one
// edit, not two, and the hold door cannot drift away from the door law it
// quotes.
//
// The extraction changed ONE thing on purpose, and it is the second half of
// this file's name. The enter arm's tolerance was a literal:
//
//     const EARSHOT_M = 60;   // world-crossings.mjs, before this lane
//
// beside a comment naming it "EARSHOT_M (60, the town's own being-part-of-a-
// scene number)". It is the town's number, the town keeps it on the record
// (`the-town/say`'s `earshot_m` predicate), and voices.mjs already reads it
// there with a per-dial disclosure. A constant that names a record it does not
// read is a falsifier that cannot fail — the town could move its own number and
// the doors would go on refusing at the old one with the new one's name. So the
// number is read, from the one reader that already reads it.
//
// ── THE TWO REACHES, AND WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES ───────────────────────
//
//   standsWithin(here, mark)  — a THRESHOLD reach: are you at this thing/door?
//                               containment first, the reach margin after.
//   withinArmsLength(a, b)    — a BESIDE reach: are you and they in one scene?
//                               plain distance, because two residents have no
//                               extent to be inside of.
//
// The law says a give is "a take at arm's length", not "a take at the same
// place", and residents are entities: an entity has no geometric extent and
// never will (kinds.md, restated at dynamic-entities.mjs law 2). So the give's
// reach cannot be a containment test even in principle, and pretending it were
// one would put a fake footprint on a person.

import { EARSHOT_M, SAY_DIALS } from "./voices.mjs";

// Re-exported so a caller that needs the NUMBER (a read that prints its own
// radius, a refusal that names it) has one import rather than two, and cannot
// reach for a different copy of it by accident.
