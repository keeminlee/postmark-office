# world2-lib.sh — what every World 2.0 box lane needs before it can do anything.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Four jobs:
#   1. put the store's credentials in the environment WITHOUT a shell expansion
#   2. hand each lane the connection shape its own tool documents
#   3. give every lane the same state-file writer, so the roll-call can read them
#   4. name the DB in exactly one place, so the prod rename is one line
#
# ── THE ONE LINE THE PROD RENAME TOUCHES ────────────────────────────────────
# WORLD2_ENV_FILE below. Today it is /etc/postmark-world2-dev.env, whose
# WORLD2_DB says world2_dev. At cutover a prod env file says world2, and every
# unit, script and manifest row here follows it without an edit. That is why
# the units are named postmark-world2-* and not postmark-world2-DEV-* — the
# unit is the mechanism, the env file is which store it points at.
#
# ── WHY THE CREDENTIALS ARE READ WITH sed AND NOT `.` ───────────────────────
# Measured on the box 2026-08-29, sourcing a sibling env file the ordinary way:
#
#     $ set -a; . /etc/postmark-office.env; set +a
#     line 2: pm_…=jennuhh:limen: command not found
#
# `.` on an env file whose values contain spaces EXECUTES fragments of the
# values. /etc/postmark-world2-dev.env happens to be clean today, but a reader
# cannot tell that from here, and the failure is silent-then-catastrophic
# rather than loud. sed extracts a value; it never runs one.
#
# ── TWO CONNECTION SHAPES, BECAUSE THE PENS DISAGREE ────────────────────────
# This is not a style choice; it is a fact about the tools, found by reading
# them rather than by trusting the call that passes between them.
#
#   law-ingest.mjs:429   const client = new pg.Client();   // PGHOST/PGDATABASE/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD
#   stamp-ingest.mjs:161 const client = new pg.Client();   // the same
#   clearing-job.mjs:62  new pg.Client({ connectionString: process.env.WORLD2_CLEARING_URL })
#   snapshot-export.mjs  new pg.Client({ connectionString: process.env.WORLD2_PG_URL })
#
# and clearing-job.mjs:58, handing off to the stamp pen for its first step:
#
#   { stdio: "inherit", env: { ...process.env, WORLD2_PG_URL: process.env.WORLD2_INGEST_URL } }
#
# THAT HAND-OFF IS INERT. stamp-ingest never reads WORLD2_PG_URL — it takes
# PG*. So the clearing's own first step connects as whatever PG* says, and if
# PG* says nothing it connects as the OS user to a database named after them
# and dies. The clearing lane therefore sets PG* to law_ingester deliberately,
# and carries clearing_job's own credential IN its URL where the PG* fallback
# cannot reach it. Get that backwards and the clearing connects as the ingester
# — which has no grant to transition a claim, so it would fail loudly rather
# than quietly, but it would fail every window until someone read this note.
#
# The password rides inside WORLD2_CLEARING_URL / WORLD2_PG_URL because those
# two clients take a connection string and PG* is already spoken for. The
# passwords were checked against [A-Za-z0-9._~-] on the box (all five, 48 chars,
# all URL-safe), so no percent-encoding pass stands between the file and the
# URL. If a future rotation issues a password with a `@` or `/` in it, THIS is
# the line that has to learn encoding first.
#
# Nothing here runs under `set -x`, and that is load-bearing rather than
# incidental: the journal is readable by group adm, and a trace of these
# functions would print the URLs.

# ── ONE TREE PER BOX (2026-09-10) ───────────────────────────────────────────
# This default was `$WORLD2_LAB/office` and it cost a crossing.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT. On 2026-09-10 the 05:45Z scheduled crossing published GREEN
# under release/2026-w37.9 and `escrow_projection` held ZERO rows after the same
# timer's clearing. `$WORLD2_LAB/office` is a SECOND office checkout at 7926461
# (2026-09-05, schema <= 012, no escrow ingest) that the release workflow never
# deploys — release-train.yml rsyncs the tag into /srv/postmark-office and
# nowhere else. Four lanes read this one line, so all four were running a tree
# three days behind the release while every heartbeat on the board read fresh.
#
# /srv/postmark-office IS the deployed release, and it is the only tree on this
# box that anything keeps up to date. `$WORLD2_LAB/office` is named here ONLY as
# the retired one: do not point a lane back at it, and if a checkout is still
# sitting there, it is residue rather than a fallback.
#
# THE UNITS SAY IT TOO, and that redundancy is deliberate: this file reaches the
# box as a HAND FILE COPY (DEPLOY.md § Where things live — "a plain file copy
# from this repo"), so a box whose copy is old still has the old default. The
# drop-in `deploy/postmark-world2-office-tree.conf` sets WORLD2_OFFICE in the
# units, where `systemctl cat` shows it and the roll-call's tree rows read it
# back. Between the two, the environment is the one that wins here — the
# roll-call therefore judges the environment and refuses to guess this default
# (deploy/box-rollcall-manifest.json § trees, `require_env`).

# does the reading. meepo never needs the file open, and the file never needs
# its mode loosened to make a lane work. That was the alternative and it is the
# wrong trade: a credential file relaxed for a timer stays relaxed for
# everything else on the box forever.
#
# The sed fallback is for a HAND-RUN by someone who can already read the file
# (`sudo -u meepo` will find nothing; `sudo bash world2-backup.sh` will).
