// settlement-registry.mjs — the crossing's household registry, decided rather
// than copied.
//
//   node deploy/settlement-registry.mjs --fresh <exported households.json> \
//        --world <sweep clone> --town-sha <the sha this crossing pinned>
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A `node -e` IN THE CHAIN ──────────────────────
//
// Same argument deploy/settlement-retry.sh makes for itself: a decision inlined
// in settlement-auto.sh can only ever be exercised by a real crossing on a real
// box, which is to say never. As its own module it is a falsifier's first
// argument (test/crossing-refreshes-the-registry.test.mjs drives it with a
// registry that moved, one that did not, and a stamp that names the wrong tree).
//
// ── WHAT IT DECIDES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. THE STAMP MUST NAME THIS CROSSING'S OWN TOWN. The export resolves
//    `town_sha` from the town clone it actually read. This asserts that sha is
//    the one the crossing pinned, and REFUSES otherwise. A registry stamped with
//    a tree other than the one its values came out of is a confident lie in
//    precisely the shape the receipt's own `rehearsal` field already guards
//    against ("the same defect as a freshness stamp naming a source it did not
//    come from") — and it is worse here, because the file outlives the crossing
//    on world main where three readers take it as live.
//
// 2. THE FILE IS REWRITTEN ONLY WHEN THE MAPPING MOVED. The export stamps a
//    fresh `generated_at` on every run, so copying it in unconditionally would
//    put a commit on world main every twelve hours forever, whether or not one
//    household changed — and would turn every quiet crossing into a crossing
//    that moved main. So the SUBSTANCE (`households` + `logins`) is compared
//    against the copy already committed in the sweep clone, and only a real
//    difference is written.
//
//    WHAT THAT MAKES `town_sha` MEAN, said out loud because a reader will ask:
//    it is the town this registry was DERIVED from, not the last town that was
//    CHECKED. An older sha means the mapping has not moved since — it does not
//    mean nobody looked. The receipt is where "did this crossing look" is
//    answered, on every crossing, including the ones that changed nothing.
//
// 3. IT SAYS WHAT MOVED. `added`, `removed` and `rekeyed` are carried by name
//    rather than as counts: a handle that LOST its household grouping, or was
//    re-keyed under a different credential, changes which parcels the fold
//    admits and which sketchbooks the wall can bind. A count would make an
//    ordinary new resident and a re-key look the same on the receipt.
//
// Output: one JSON object on stdout. Exit 0 decided, 1 refused (with `refused`
// and `detail` on the object, the shape the chain's other helpers use).
