# site-refresh-selftest.sh — the falsifiers for deploy/site-refresh.sh.
#
#   bash deploy/site-refresh-selftest.sh
#
# WHY A SHELL HARNESS AND NOT A test/*.test.mjs. The three things that have to be
# true about the refresh script are things only a real POSIX environment can
# demonstrate: that `flock` actually excludes a second process, that a symlink
# swap is a rename and not a gap, and that a run whose inputs have not moved
# genuinely does nothing. A node test that re-implemented any of those would be
# asserting about its own re-implementation. So this drives the REAL script.
#
# It is deliberately NOT wired into `npm test`: this box's dev machine is
# Windows, and a falsifier that skips itself is not a falsifier. It runs by hand,
# and INSTALL step 4 in site-refresh.sh's header is where it earns its keep.
#
# THE SANDBOX. Three local git repos stand in for the town, the site and the
# world; `npm` is shimmed onto PATH so no network and no astro are involved. What
# is real: git, flock, rsync, the symlink swap, the state file, the snapshot key,
# the convergence loop — every decision the script makes.
#
# THE LAW THESE ASSERT, from EPICS/POSTMARK/freshness-architecture.md:
#
#   "a 30-minute timer, phase-aligned ~:10 after the ferry crossings (the known
#    moments mail actually moves), lockfile single-flight, atomic
#    temp-build-then-symlink-swap (zero downtime; no stale-over-fresh ordering
#    race)."
#
# Each clause is one test below, and the defect each closes is named in it.
