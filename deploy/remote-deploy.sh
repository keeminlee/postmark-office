# remote-deploy.sh — the box-side half of the office's auto-deploy (POS-60).
#
# Runs ON THE BOX, as the deploy user, invoked over ssh by
# .github/workflows/release-train.yml. It never fetches, clones or checks out:
# the code arrives by rsync from the runner, which has already checked out the
# release tag. This script only installs deps if the lockfile moved, restarts the
# service, and then PROVES the restart served the new code.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE LAWS THIS SCRIPT IS BUILT FROM, quoted so a later reader can check it
# against them rather than against my summary of them.
#
# deploy/DEPLOY.md, the live-truth note (2026-07-19):
#
#   "the box's `/srv/postmark-office` is a plain file copy, NOT the git clone
#    step 1 below describes — a code deploy is
#    `scp src/<changed>.mjs meepo-ec2:/srv/postmark-office/src/` +
#    `sudo systemctl restart postmark-office`, then probe a route whose response
#    only the new code produces (a restart alone proves nothing)."
#
# deploy/DEPLOY.md § The one-hand rule (2026-08-20):
#
#   "meepo is the only hand that touches `/srv/postmark-office`. Root never
#    writes there — not a file, and NEVER git."
#   "A deploy scp that bounces on permissions is fixed by `chown`, never by
#    escalating the deploy to sudo."
#
# That pair is why the file copy runs as the deploy user with no sudo anywhere
# near it, while `systemctl restart` — which is not a write to /srv — uses
# `sudo -n`. The `-n` is deliberate: without it a box that wants a password
# HANGS the deploy until the job times out, and a deploy that hangs reads as a
# slow deploy rather than a broken one. `-n` makes it fail in a second, loudly.
#
# deploy/DEPLOY.md § Notes (2026-08-11):
#
#   "A restart is now for code deploys only; data flows by hot-reload."
#
# which is why nothing here touches town-clone/, world-clone*/, office.db or any
# other derived state. The rehydrate timer owns the data tense; this owns code.
#
# OPERATIONS.md § Deploys (founder-ruled 2026-08-26):
#
#   "code moves on trains; the record is never promoted — it is either alive
#    (prod) or certified-frozen (dev)."
