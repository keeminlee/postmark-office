// crossing-registry-real-sweep.test.mjs — THE REAL WORLD SWEEP, NOT THE STUB.
//
//   node --test --test-timeout=180000 test/crossing-registry-real-sweep.test.mjs
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `test/crossing-refreshes-the-registry.test.mjs` drives a whole crossing in a
// bottle, and its fixture world carries a `tools/settlement-sweep.mjs` that this
// office repo WROTE — a stub that publishes, reports six channels, and reads
// nothing about the registry. That stub is right for what those tests assert
// (what the CHAIN does), and it blinded them completely to what the WORLD does:
// the first cut of this lane shipped a guard that refused the crossing after
// every quiet one, and F2 asserted the opposite and passed, because the stub
// could not refuse anything.
//
// A falsifier whose fixture cannot express the failure is not a falsifier. So
// this file stands up a real world checkout's OWN `settlement-sweep.mjs` and
// hands it the flags the chain hands it.
//
// ── THE CONTRACT UNDER TEST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The office holds the town clone, so the office is the only side that can know
// whether the registry was checked against the live town. It states that, and
// the world checks the statement:
//
//   --registry-verified-at <sha>   checked this crossing. FRESH, whatever stamp
//                                  the file carries — a registry the refresh
//                                  re-derived and found unchanged keeps an older
//                                  one, and the town moves 150-300 commits a day.
//   --registry-unverified <reason> deliberately not checked. NEVER a refusal.
//   neither                        no crossing context; not armed.
//
// ── WHAT A FAILURE HERE MEANS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// If the world checkout this test finds does not understand those flags, this
// file goes RED rather than skipping. That is deliberate: the office half is
// only correct alongside the world half, and a red here is that coupling made
// mechanical instead of left in a paragraph of a report.
