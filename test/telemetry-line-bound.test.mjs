// telemetry-line-bound.test.mjs — the shared access log stays atomically
// appendable when N read workers write to it (runbook DEC-4 / G3, conductor-
// accepted repair 2026-09-08).
//
// THE CLASS. A POSIX `O_APPEND` write is atomic only up to PIPE_BUF (4096 on
// Linux). Past that the kernel may split it, and two workers writing long lines
// at the same instant interleave — two unparseable lines where there were two
// good ones. Every reader of this file does `try { JSON.parse } catch
// { continue }`, so a torn line is dropped in SILENCE and takes the innocent
// partner line with it.
//
// This file drives `accessLine` rather than grepping `telemetry.mjs` for a
// `.slice(` — a check on the code's text is not a check on its behaviour, which
// is the carry this whole lane keeps meeting.
