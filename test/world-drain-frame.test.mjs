// world-drain-frame.test.mjs — THE MOUNTAIN THAT THE MACHINERY MOVED.
//
// ── THE LIVE CASE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 2026-08-27T01:13:12.971Z, an amend of `vermillion/the-pando-peak` drained, and
// the record that landed on `draft/FluffUPando` said (Wright's revert diff,
// world `577a1b6e`, verbatim):
//
//   -kind: sited
//    by: vermillion
//   -date: 2026-08-27T01:13:12.971Z
//   -at: { x: -95458, y: -95458 }
//   +date: 2026-07-24
//   +at: { x: 0, y: 0 }
//    extent: { w: 3600, h: 3600 }
//
// The file sits at `WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/pando-peak/the-pando-peak/
// mark.md` — nested under the `pando-peak` region, whose COMPOSED CENTRE is
// exactly (-95458, -95458). The standing record said `at: { x: 0, y: 0 }`,
// meaning "at the centre of pando-peak", which composes to (-95458, -95458) —
// the mountain's true world position. The drained amend wrote the WORLD
// coordinate into that relative frame, so it composed to about
// (-190916, -190916): ~95km outside the world, and the landing that stands on
// this peak went with it. Eleven vessel/timetable tests red at 03:22:57Z; the
// whole town's crossing refused; a human reverted it by hand at 03:50Z.
//
// THE RESIDENT MOVED NOTHING. They restated their mountain's true world position
// — which is precisely what the journal is specified to store. The machinery
// doubled it.
//
// ── WHY IT SURVIVED THE TESTS THAT EXIST ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world-drain.test.mjs` carries a test literally named "THE FREEZE — a sited
// draft is never nested, so the write-down's frame conversion has no live caller
// at this door", whose framer THROWS if reached. It passes, and it is not wrong:
// its fixture is a CREATE, `publishedPathOf` answers null for the mark, Gate B
// files it at `WORLD/marks/<by>/<slug>/`, and that really is root-framed.
//
// An AMEND is the other gate. Gate A hands a mark that main already holds its
// FROZEN FOSSIL FILING — three segments deep, nested, relative-framed — so the
// framer IS reached. It then could not answer, because it resolved its origin
// from `parent_id` and a sited mark carries no `parent_id` in the door's
// grammar. `{}` came back, and `{}` reads exactly like "root-level, nothing to
// shift".
//
// The premise was TRUE when it was written and the freeze made it false on
// 2026-08-25. The comment went on being read as current for two days.
