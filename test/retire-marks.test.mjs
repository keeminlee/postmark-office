// retire-marks.test.mjs — the falsifiers for the retire step at the settlement
// seam (G1 lane 1).
//
// THE LAW EACH ONE QUOTES. `retireMarks` exists because of one sentence in
// 001_tables.sql, which has been true and unenforced since the first migration:
//
//   marks.status  text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'standing'
//                 CHECK (status IN ('standing','retired'))   (001_tables.sql:109-110)
//   retired_window integer REFERENCES windows(id)            (001_tables.sql:112)
//
// A column with a CHECK nobody writes is a law with no pen. These tests are the
// pen's proof.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP, REPRODUCIBLE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The flip is the exact four-line edit recorded in `materialize.mjs`'s
// `retireMarks` header (§ THE CAN-FAIL FLIP, AS A DIFF). Apply it, then:
//
//   node --test test/retire-marks.test.mjs
//     → 9 tests · 6 pass · 3 fail        (re-run 2026-09-08 on 9259657)
//   node --test test/retire-marks.test.mjs test/settlement-receipt-retired.test.mjs
//     → 15 tests · 12 pass · 3 fail      (first run, on 6b9045f)
//
// Same three reds either way — the second command only adds six green receipt
// tests, which is why the two numbers differ and neither is wrong. Naming the
// COMMAND beside the count is the repair: "12 pass / 3 fail" alone cannot be
// checked by anyone who runs a different file set.
//
// THE THREE REDS: tests 1, 2 and 4. The greens: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
//
// WHY THE FLIP IS A SELECT AND NOT A DELETED LINE: the `register` stub below
// THROWS on SQL it does not model, so most ways of "removing the write" produce
// an error rather than this split. The chosen SELECT is one the stub already
// answers, which is what makes the flip runnable at all — the detail my first
// prose write-up lost, and the reviewer's repair 3.
//
// I PREDICTED FOUR REDS AND GOT THREE, kept rather than quietly corrected. I
// expected test 6 (the missing-window refusal) to red; it does not, because its
// throw happens BEFORE the UPDATE is reached, so it never touches the disabled
// code. The test is right and the prediction was wrong — it guards an argument,
// not a write.
//
// The half that matters: tests 3 and 5 are the negative controls and they
// stayed GREEN under the flip. A control that reds when the feature is removed
// was never a control.
