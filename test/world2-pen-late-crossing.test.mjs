// world2-pen-late-crossing.test.mjs — A LATE ROW MAY NOT ENTER A CERTIFIED WINDOW.
//
// The law, quoted: gold §2 — an archive is "frozen-on-write, an input never
// re-derived-into"; the notary lane's own refusal (2026-09-03, act 4171):
// "An archive is frozen on write. This is drift and a FINDING — the notary will
// not overwrite it. Either the file was edited, or the office rewrote history in
// a window it had already closed. Both want a human."
//
// The pen's guard makes the second case unwritable: a row whose crossing is older
// than the window just closed is refused by name, and a sanctioned late arrival
// files into the window it ARRIVES in (W2_LATE_ARRIVAL names the reason), never
// the certified one. Receipts: notary-history/164-act-4171-repair; the 09-04
// holdings backfill (acts 4220–4224, filed at 168 with their true `at`).
//
