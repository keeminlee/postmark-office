// settlement-receipt-source.test.mjs — WHERE THIS CROSSING'S RECORD CAME FROM.
//
// THE LAW IT QUOTES is settlement-receipt.mjs's own founding rule — the
// founder's 2026-08-27 mandate, verbatim from that file's header:
//
//   "A CROSSING NAMES EVERY CHANNEL IT HAS A WORD FOR, INCLUDING THE EMPTY
//    ONES, AND A PASS THAT PUBLISHED NOTHING SAYS WHAT IT SURVEYED."
//
// After G1 the crossing has a word for something it never had before: which
// record it folded. `source` and `as_of` are held to that sentence here, and the
// half that matters most is the EMPTY one — a git crossing must say `source:
// "git"` out loud rather than leaving the field off. A field that appears only
// when the answer is interesting teaches its reader that absence means "git",
// and then the first receipt that is missing it for any other reason hands them
// a wrong answer to the most consequential question on the page.
//
// The second thing under test is the pairing. `as_of` must be null on a git
// crossing rather than echoing the git shas: there was no store read, and a
// triple copied from somewhere else is the freshness-stamp defect — one answer
// wearing another source's stamp.
