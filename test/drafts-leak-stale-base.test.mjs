// drafts-leak-stale-base.test.mjs — THE READER THAT PUT OTHER HOUSEHOLDS'
// MARKS IN A RESIDENT'S `drafts` LIST.
//
// #2556, and postmark-town/postmark#2526's own defect wearing a second face.
//
// ── WHAT THE WALKS SAW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 2026-09-06 05:53 EDT: `read: "leave-mark"` answered `household: keeminlee,
// branch: draft/keeminlee, drafts: 18` — and fifteen were by berthillon,
// current-the-reader and histor-reeves. 2026-09-07 09:53Z, on prod: wright's
// `drafts` held `current-the-reader/the-decks` and `.../the-toucan-poster`,
// `berthillon/pistache-cone-for-julian` (DELETED) and
// `little-m-of-garrison/a-cluster-of-phaenolepis-garrisonii` (ADDED).
//
// ── WHAT IT IS NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not the docket store. Every `claims` reader in `src/` at the base filters on
// `household` (`pgLiveMarks`: `status = ANY($1) AND household = $2`;
// `readDraftClaims`: `status='draft' AND household=$1`), and the operator's
// prod SELECT settled the data question: those rows carry `solo:devadavisson` /
// `solo:berthillon` / `solo:kristinashoultz-wq`, never wright's `gh:67605380`,
// so no household-scoped query could return them. My earlier report inferred
// the store half and the inference was wrong.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS: THE SKETCHBOOK HALF, AGAINST A STALE BASE ──────────────────
//
// `draftDeltaForKey` computes
//
//     base      = mainRef(repo)                    ← refs/heads/main, LOCAL
//     mergeBase = git merge-base <base> <draftRef>
//     diff        <mergeBase> <draftRef> -- WORLD/marks
//
// and the Worldkeeper REBASES every `draft/<household>` onto the new main at
// each settlement. So on the box the two refs sit like this:
//
//     refs/heads/main        S58   ← moves only on the crossing-save's pull
//     draft/<household>      rebased onto S61, so S59/S60/S61 are IN ITS ANCESTRY
//
// `merge-base(S58, that)` is **S58**, and the diff from S58 to the draft branch
// therefore contains EVERY MARK EVERY HOUSEHOLD PUBLISHED AT S59, S60 AND S61 —
// as `added` — plus everything those settlements removed, as `deleted`. The
// household's own sketchbook is a handful of rows inside that.
//
// The function's own comment describes this exact class in the other direction:
//
//   "A two-dot diff reports everything main gained since divergence as
//    deletions the household is 'proposing' — the convergence's 172 published
//    marks once rendered as 171 phantom deletion intents this way."
//
// The merge-base fixed the DIRECTION and the base stayed stale, so the same
// class came back as additions. #2526 and #2556 are one defect at two doors.
//
// ── AND THE FIX IS ALREADY IN THIS BRANCH ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Commit 1 moved `draftDeltaForKey`'s base to `freshestMainRef`. With a fresh
// base the merge-base is main's own tip and the diff is the household's work.
// These legs go RED at the base and green here, which is the whole point:
// nothing new is added to fix this, and the leg is what keeps it fixed.
