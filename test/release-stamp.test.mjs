// release-stamp.test.mjs — POS-60: the office's deploy receipt.
//
// THE LAW THIS ASSERTS, quoted verbatim from deploy/DEPLOY.md's live-truth note
// (2026-07-19), because a falsifier that paraphrases its law drifts off it:
//
//   "a code deploy is `scp src/<changed>.mjs meepo-ec2:/srv/postmark-office/src/`
//    + `sudo systemctl restart postmark-office`, then probe a route whose
//    response only the new code produces (a restart alone proves nothing)."
//
// The clause under test is the parenthesis. `GET /release` is the route whose
// response only the newly-deployed code produces, and these cases pin the three
// ways it could quietly stop being that:
//
//   1. a stamp that names a release  -> the door reports THAT release  (it works)
//   2. no stamp at all               -> `deployed: false`, never green  (a
//      hand-placed box, and every box before this shipped, must still boot)
//   3. a stamp that is present but says nothing usable -> also not green (a
//      truncated or half-written file must not read as a successful deploy)
//
// And the second law, from OPERATIONS.md § Deploys (founder-ruled 2026-08-26):
//
//   "code moves on trains; the record is never promoted — it is either alive
//    (prod) or certified-frozen (dev)."
//
// which is why the stamp carries `target`: a receipt that cannot say whether it
// was the prod hand or the dev hand that wrote it lets a rehearsal be mistaken
// for a release.
