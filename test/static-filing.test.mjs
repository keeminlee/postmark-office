// THE LAW, quoted verbatim, because these falsifiers assert it and not a brief
// (LOGOS/state-and-time.md § "The freeze — filing is static, and the tree is a
// fossil"; founder-ruled 2026-08-25, world main 258af3d6):
//
//   "Filing is frozen as of 2026-08-25. A mark's directory is its historical
//    filing: it carries no claim, and it never moves again. New marks are filed
//    by identity — WORLD/marks/<household>/<slug>/ — and containment lives only
//    in the derived fold, emitted as an artifact each settlement."
//
//   "The re-home pass is DELETED from the settlement save. The settlement writes
//    a mark once; nothing moves it after."
//
//   "'The tree is the map' moves to where derived views live: the fold emits the
//    containment map beside `world-state.json` every settlement. The browsable
//    truth is generated; the source files rest."
//
// The office half is four changes and this file is their falsifier:
//
//   1. the live write door (world-journal.mjs `pathFor`) files sited/parcel at
//      the mark's id, and predication still nests;
//   2. `contains` edges are read from WORLD/containment.json, with a LOUD
//      fallback to directory nesting for a clone from before the freeze;
//   3. the keeping-works gate — whether a mark may MINT A VERB — is re-keyed
//      from a path substring to containment, in SQL and in JS, from ONE
//      implementation;
//   4. `containmentSpine` follows the re-keyed edges.
//
// Every check here flips: each one has a companion asserting the OTHER answer,
// so a gate that always says yes and a gate that always says no both go red.
