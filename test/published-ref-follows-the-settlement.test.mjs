// published-ref-follows-the-settlement.test.mjs — the READ tier answers from
// published main, and the office's two published-main readers agree.
//
// THE LAW THIS ASSERTS, verbatim, from the ruling the office already wrote down
// (`src/world-serve.mjs § publishedMainSha`, 2026-08-17):
//
//   "mainRef()'s local-preference is right for the WRITE paths (a draft forks
//    from the freshest local line mid-settlement) and was wrong here: on
//    2026-08-17 the as-of bar read the lag backwards and reported the store
//    BEHIND a 'main' that was itself two commits stale. The published sha is
//    the DESCENDANT when the two disagree; a truly diverged pair falls to
//    origin, because published truth is what the world can clone."
//
// and, on the ref the tick moves (`deploy/office-tick.sh:37-42`):
//
//   "The world clone gets FETCH, never pull: its checkout is the write pen's
//    (ensureDraftCheckout reseats it per-write) … Reads only need origin refs
//    freshened."
//
// ── WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY A SECOND READER IS THE CLASS ──────────────────
//
// That ruling was applied to `publishedMainSha` (the as-of bar) and to
// `freshestMainRef` (the engine), and NOT to `publishedState` — the function
// that produces the world every read serves. So on 2026-09-06 a mark published
// by the 05:45Z settlement came back from the focus as "no mark or terrain
// feature" for six hours, until the crossing-save's 12:02Z pull moved
// `refs/heads/main`; and the SAME answer stamped `law.as_of_world` with the
// newer sha, because `world.db` is hydrated `--ref origin/main`
// (`deploy/office-tick.sh:73`). One object, two sources, and the fresh one
// certified the stale one. postmark-town/postmark#2526.
//
// Three readers of one fact is how they drift, so the last three tests here
// BIND them: across all four states a clone can be in, `freshestMainRef` and
// `publishedMainSha` must name the same commit. If a future change moves one
// and not the other, this goes red before a resident reads a stale world.
