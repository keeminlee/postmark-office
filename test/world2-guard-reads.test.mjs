// world2-guard-reads.test.mjs — the folds in `world2/tools/guard-reads.mjs`,
// exercised without a store.
//
// The equality falsifier (`falsifier-guard-equality.mjs`) is the real proof and
// it needs Postgres, a world checkout and a scratch database. This suite covers
// what that one CANNOT reach on this box, plus the arithmetic that would be
// silly to need a database for:
//
//   · THE LIVE HOLDING ERA. Nothing has been given, dropped or taken since the
//     mirror shipped (2026-08-28), so `acts` holds no `give`/`drop`/`take` row
//     and the falsifier's G5 exercises the frozen era only. The trap in that
//     era — `acts.actor` is the DECLARER, not the holder — is therefore tested
//     here, on rows shaped exactly as `mirrorHoldingAct` writes them.
//   · THE REFUSALS. A guard that skipped a row it could not read would PERMIT
//     wrongly, which is the one failure mode this port cannot have. Every
//     refusal branch is asserted to throw rather than to return a short list.
//   · THE ORDER GUARD. `assertAttachmentOrder` is what stands between
//     "latest wins" and whoever the seed inserted last.
