// state-log-write.test.mjs — the writer, and the refusal my own diff would have caused.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE OF, and it was mine. Lap 1 proposed a
// wiring diff that wrote the photograph into the sweep clone's working tree and
// left it UNCOMMITTED, citing `world-drain.mjs`'s "committing it is the
// settlement pass's act" note. Two things wrong, either fatal:
//
//   `tools/settlement-sweep.mjs:892` classifies the tree before doing anything —
//   `worktreeDirt` runs `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`, so an
//   UNTRACKED STATE file is REAL dirt — and `:893` throws "settlement sweep
//   needs a clean checkout". Every store crossing would have refused, by name,
//   on a file the diff itself wrote.
//
//   And the note I cited describes a DEFAULT-OFF flag. `deploy/settlement-auto.
//   sh:219` overrides it: `--commit-state` "is required, not optional". On prod
//   the drain commits STATE itself; I quoted its off-by-default caveat as the
//   practice.
//
// W1 is the repair and W1-CONTROL is the defect, asserted rather than described.
