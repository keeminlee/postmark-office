//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES, in the reviewer's words: "No test names either" — the
// slice and the nginx confs had no check anywhere in `test/`, so the two
// artifacts that decide what a read worker RECEIVES were the only part of this
// lane nothing could contradict.
//
// It cost a real defect. The method map sends every GET under /api/ to the
// pool; the office's `workerSafe` correctly refuses /oauth* there. Both halves
// were right on their own and disagreed with each other, and the disagreement
// was invisible because nothing compared them. `§ 1` below is that comparison,
// and it is mechanical: it asks the CONF which upstream a path reaches, asks
// `workerSafe` whether a worker would serve it, and fails on any path where the
// two answers differ.
//
// What it cannot see, said plainly: this parses the conf, it does not run
// nginx. Directive semantics (does `^~` really beat the regex on this build?)
// are proven by driving a scratch nginx, which the report records; this file
// catches the class of mistake that survives a green drive because nobody
// thought to drive that path.
