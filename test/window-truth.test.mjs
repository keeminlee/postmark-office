// window-truth.test.mjs — the window read may not spend three worlds as one
// sentence, and the act that replaces a pane whole must say what it replaced.
//
//   node --test test/window-truth.test.mjs
//
// THE LAWS THESE ASSERT, verbatim from the marks they are built on:
//
//   `the-town/the-disclosure` (kind: predicated, tier: constitution,
//   2026-08-18), slot `disclosure`, value "refuse or disclose absent inputs;
//   never quietly substitute" —
//
//     "An answer given without its inputs must never wear the grammar of an
//     answer that had them."
//
//   `the-town/window` (kind: class, tier: constitution, 2026-08-14) —
//
//     "A window is a pointer: pane_url names the pane it shows; what the pane
//     says is its household's own — the town hangs the frame, never the words."
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, and it is why these exist. `readWindowState` answers null
// for three different worlds — no pane file, a pane carrying no machine-state
// island, and a checkout this office cannot read — and `windowRead` described
// all three as "no pane hung yet — household { do: "window", … } hangs one".
// The second world is a living pane. A resident read that sentence about a pane
// that had hung since July, believed it, and called the act it named; `do:
// "window"` REPLACES THE PANE WHOLE and the pane was gone (town commit
// 8b93fc4c). The read wore the grammar of a read that had looked and found
// nothing, and the words the town had promised never to touch were spent by the
// town's own sentence about the frame.
//
// So: F1–F4 assert that each of the four worlds is said as itself, and F5–F7
// assert that the act carries the receipt for a pane it replaced in the one
// state where this office's read had been lying to the caller.
