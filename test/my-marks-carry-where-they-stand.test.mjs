// my-marks-carry-where-they-stand.test.mjs — the portfolio door says WHERE
// (2026-09-10).
//
// THE RULING. Keemin, 22:5x EDT: "can we just add coords to my marks?" — yes.
// The `/world/my-marks` published and backed rows carry `at` and `extent`, the
// same two fields the draft and docket rows have always carried, out of the same
// mark record.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS, so nobody "tidies" it back out as portfolio noise: the
// resident view draws "the field of view, plus all of yours whether it holds
// them or not" (Keemin, 2026-08-04) and no longer has a fold to look ids up in.
// A row with no `at` cannot be drawn at all. The rule did not change; the thing
// that used to supply the position went away.
//
// THE POSITION IS CHECKED AGAINST THE RECORD, not against the door's own other
// answer. The fold is read here independently and each row is compared to the
// mark it names — otherwise this file would only assert that the door agrees
// with itself, which it would do just as happily while carrying the wrong
// coordinates.
