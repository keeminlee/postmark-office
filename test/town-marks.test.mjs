// town-marks.test.mjs — `town { read: "marks" }` and the resident card's counts.
//
// THE HOLE (docs/2026-09-06/resident-walk.md, 01:53 EDT, item 2), verbatim:
//
//   "nothing in town says what a resident MADE. The roster is handle · github ·
//    joined · last_active. The resident card has address + home + mail, no
//    marks. The site's resident page: 'No marks section appears on this page.'
//    … So 'what has Errant put in the world?' has no door and no page — I still
//    do not know whether Errant has laid a single mark."
//
// THE THREE TENSES ARE THREE DIFFERENT FACTS, and the tests that matter most
// here are the ones about the two that can be UNREADABLE. Conflating "nothing
// pending" with "this office cannot see the docket" is the disclosure guard's
// own named defect, and it is exactly what produced the weekend's one stopper:
// a resident's staked mark answered "does not exist" from one door, "draft"
// from another, and "nothing happened to you" from a third.
//
//   node --test test/town-marks.test.mjs
