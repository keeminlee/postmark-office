// movement-fixture.mjs — a running ferry service in a bottle, for Stage D.
//
// Two things, and nothing else:
//
//   a world CLONE   a git repo with a `main` carrying the world's REAL
//                   `tools/walk.mjs`, `tools/vessel.mjs` and `tools/geometry.mjs`
//                   — copied, not reimplemented. The dynamic-layer fixture
//                   writes a faithful MINIATURE of walk.mjs because what it
//                   falsifies is whether the saved bytes carry enough to
//                   reconstitute a world, and the arithmetic cancels on both
//                   sides of that comparison. Here it does not cancel: what is
//                   under test IS the arithmetic — where a scheduled boat is at
//                   an instant, and whether standing on her deck at a cast-off
//                   carries you. A miniature timetable would only ever prove
//                   that the miniature agrees with itself.
//
//   a MARKS ARRAY   a two-stop line and a vessel with a real footprint. Passed
//                   to the movement module directly, because `movementStandpoint`
//                   takes the folded world as an argument — so a fixture world
//                   needs no directory tree, no fold, and no lint.
//
// The clone must be a git repo with a main branch because the office reads
// engine code AT A REF and never from a working tree; a fixture that skipped
// that would be testing an import path the office does not use.
